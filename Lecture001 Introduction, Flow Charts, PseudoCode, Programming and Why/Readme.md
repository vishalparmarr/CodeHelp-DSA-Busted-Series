# In this video, We would learn about what is flow chart & what is pseudocode. What is use of programming and why to do programming?

**Flow Chart:** It is visual representation of program using diagrams and shapes having a fixed meaning.

Example :

- In a flow chart the **Eclipse** denotes the starting and end of the program.
- **Parallelogram** denotes the input or output statement.
- **Rectangle** denotes the calculation or some arithmetic operations.
- **Rhombus** denotes the decision or comparison etc.
  
**Note : There is no symbol or shape for loops but decision shape can be used to make loop.**

- **Pseudocode:** It is general instructions without any syntax but once it is written it can be easily converted into a code.

- **Programming Languages** are special languages which can be converted into computer understandable format which is written in a fix format known as syntax.

We know that a computer can perform calculations and other action better than human beings but we can't give instructions directly to computer as it only understand 0 and 1. so we write a program in a human understandable format and then a program convert it into the computer understandable program this program is known as compiler.
